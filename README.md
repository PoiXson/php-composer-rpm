Composer: Dependency Manager for PHP
====================================

Homepage: http://getcomposer.org

This is a quick/dirty way to package composer.
It should be done properly by building from source instead.

It looks like Shawn Iwinski is working on this but it is incomplete:
* https://github.com/siwinski/php-composer-rpms/
* http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/siwinski/php-composer/

But as of 2013-04-25 there are no RPMs in the repo.
